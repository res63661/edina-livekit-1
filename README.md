# LiveKit SDK Example App for iOS & macOS

This app demonstrates the basic usage of [LiveKit Swift SDK (iOS/macOS)](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-swift). See [LiveKit Docs](https://docs.livekit.io/) for more information.

### Compiled version

Precompiled macOS version is available from the [Releases page](https://github.com/livekit/client-example-swift/releases), so you can quickly try out features of the [LiveKit Swift SDK](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-swift) or the [LiveKit Server](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-server).

Precompiled iOS version can be downloaded on [Apple TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/21F6ARiQ). Click on the link from an iOS device and follow the instructions.

# How to run the example

### Get the code

1. Clone this [LiveKit Swift Example](https://github.com/livekit/client-example-swift) repo.
2. Open `LiveKitExample.xcodeproj` (not the `-dev.xcworkspace`).
3. Wait for packages to sync.

### Change bundle id & code signing information
1. Select the `LiveKitExample` project from the left Navigator.
2. For each **Target**, select **Signing & Capabilities** tab and update your **Team** and **Bundle Identifier** to your preference.

### üöÄ Run
1. Select `LiveKitExample (iOS)` or `LiveKitExample (macOS)` from the **Scheme selector** at the top of Xcode.
2. **Run** the project from the menu **Product** ‚Üí **Run** or by ‚åòR.

If you encounter code signing issues, make sure you change the **Team** and **bundle id** from the previous step.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Connect

1. Prepare & Start [LiveKit Server](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-server). See the [Getting Started page](https://docs.livekit.io/guides/getting-started) for more information.
2. Generate an access token.
3. Enter the **Server URL** and **Access token** to the example app and tap **Connect**.

Server URL would typically look like `ws://localhost:7880` depending on your configuration. It should start with `ws://` for *non-secure* and `wss://` for *secure* connections.

### ‚úÖ Permissions

iOS/macOS will ask you to grant permission when enabling **Camera**, **Microphone** and/or **Screen Share**. Simply allow this to continue publishing the track.

#### macOS Screen Share

Open **Settings** ‚Üí **Security & Privacy** ‚Üí **Screen Recording** and make sure **LiveKitExample** has a ‚úîÔ∏è mark. You will need to restart the app.

# Troubleshooting

### Package errors

If you get package syncing errors, try *resetting your package caches* by right clicking **Package Dependencies** and choosing **Reset Package Caches** from the **Navigator**.
